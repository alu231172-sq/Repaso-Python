What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular languages in the world for beginners and professionals alike.

Why Learn Python?
Easy to Read and Write: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and mirrors natural language, making it easier to learn and understand.
Versatile: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, scientific computing, and much more.
Large Community & Resources: With a vast community, finding tutorials, libraries, and support is easy.
Cross-platform: Python can run on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more.
Basic Features
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
Dynamically Typed: You don’t need to declare the type of a variable; Python figures it out at runtime.
Object-Oriented: Supports classes and objects, though you can also write code in a procedural style.
Example: Hello World
Here’s how you’d print "Hello, World!" in Python:

Python
print("Hello, World!")
Basic Syntax
Variables: No need to declare the data type.
Python
x = 10
name = "Alice"
Indentation: Indentation (spaces or tabs) is used to define code blocks, not curly braces {}.
Python
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
Comments: Start with #
Python
# This is a comment
